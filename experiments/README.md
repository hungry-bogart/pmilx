# Experimentation notes

This directory is here for your experimental changes to the render.py file.
This space is where you can try crazy things and feel good about what you have
broken in the process.

Remember, change your file paths to match where you want you experimental files to go.

I recommend you copy the working render.py script into this experimentation directory, update file paths to point here, and create a workspace that works for you.

Have fun!
